# ASSESSMENT 1
## Core concepts: conditionals, method writing

# OVERVIEW
Create a C# console application that utilizes methods and conditional statements.
Your completed application should include three methods that perform the required actions and follow proper naming conventions. 

# BUILD SPECIFICATIONS
The assessment is worth ten points, one for each of the test cases blow. Pay special attention to the items in bold. You must use these in your program exactly, including capitalization, in order to get the points.
 You will write your methods inside of your Program class. You will not be graded on what’s in your Main method, though you are encouraged to test your code as you write it.

Create a static method named IsTheSame() that returns a bool and takes in two numbers (int) as parameters.

If num1 is equal to num2, return true.

If num1 is not equal to num2, return false.

Create a static method named Subtract() that takes in 2 parameters, all doubles: num1, num2.

This method should return the difference of num2 from num1.

Create a static method named FindBuildingType() takes in a number (int) as a parameter. (The following ranges are inclusive.)

If the number is between 4 and 10, return “This is an office building!”

If the number is over 50, return “This is a SUPER skyscraper!” 

If a number is between 11 and 49, return “This is a skyscraper!”
